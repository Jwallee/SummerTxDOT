just a placeholder so the folder appears in the repo lol

What is dataLocal?

For me, I kept seeing how we use files in reference to the root user, so I wanted to fix it so it can be used in any context.

You load all the data into the dataLocal folder, so the referneced filepaths do not change between users, because it's relative to the project, not the user.

For example, change something like [crash_training_data_filepath = r"C:\Users\aseibel\Documents\data\crash_data_1.csv"] to
[
import os

# Get the directory of the running script
current_directory = os.path.dirname(__file__)

# Construct the relative path to the data file
crash_training_data_filepath = os.path.join(current_directory, 'dataLocal', 'crash_data_1
.csv')
]

Tested it and it worked, but all filepaths (not only in shell, but MultiPipelineHandler and feature_selection as well) would need to be like this, and all data stored in dataLocal.
